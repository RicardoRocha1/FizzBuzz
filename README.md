# FizzBuzz
Three very simple FizzBuzz problem solutions: With for loop, with while loop and with with for loop and string concatenation
Although this is the simpler method of solving the most usual FizzBuzz problem (with only Fizz for divisible by 3 and Buzz for divisible by 5) it is not the most recommended as it's complexity starts to increase exponentially
with more terms and conditions added.
